# Youtube knows me inside out ??? Probably ...

This project aims to analyze what my youtube watch historyand youtube searched looks like. This probably shouldn't be public information but you know who cares, all of our private information is pretty much exposed anyways with all the social networking that we do constantly.

In this I look at a few things:

1. What was the first video I watched ?
2. How old is my watch history ?
3. How many videos I watch (on average) per day ?
4. My most watched videos ?
5. Wordcloud of what the title I mostly search or videos that are watched frequently (It is pretty evident that my searches and watched history are heavily reliant on my frame of mind that day!!!!)
6. How many unique channels i have watched and which are the ones I watch the most ? (This seems to have gone diversified since Lockdown started in March 2020!!)
7. What are my most searched titles or keywords ?
